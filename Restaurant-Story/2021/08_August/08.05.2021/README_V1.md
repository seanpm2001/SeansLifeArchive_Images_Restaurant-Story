# Restaurant Story session August 5th 2021

<!-- I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 1 batch of chicken and dumplings, and 3 batches of bacon and eggs today. !-->

I had a longer and less interactive session today, making 1 batch of Fruit salad (15 minutes each) and 1 batch of bagels (15 minutes each) I did other things again while playing today.

The game did not crash today. Not much else was done, although I wasn't trying to brush past the gameplay again today.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview
