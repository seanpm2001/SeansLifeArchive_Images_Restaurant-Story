# Restaurant Story session August 12th 2021

<!-- I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 1 batch of chicken and dumplings, and 3 batches of bacon and eggs today. !-->

I had a much shorter and less interactive session today, making 1 batch of bacon and eggs (3 minutes each) then quitting.

The game did not crash today. Not much else was done. <!-- although I wasn't trying to brush past the gameplay again today. !-->

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview
