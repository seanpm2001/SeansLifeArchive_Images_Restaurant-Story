# Restaurant Story session July 8th 2021

<!-- I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 1 batch of chicken and dumplings, and 3 batches of bacon and eggs today. !-->

I had a shortened session today, only making 1 batch of omelettes before quitting. I now have over 10000 omelettes stocked up (10250 total)

The game did not crash today. Not much else was done, although I wasn't trying to brush past the gameplay again today.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
