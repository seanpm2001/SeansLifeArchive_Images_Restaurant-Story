# Restaurant Story session July 22nd 2021

<!-- I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 1 batch of chicken and dumplings, and 3 batches of bacon and eggs today. !-->

I had a longer and sporadic session today, making several batches of bacon and eggs, 2 batches of French toast, and 1 batch of Bagels. I finished building an appliance, and will have an additonal oven to use next week.

The game did not crash today. Not much else was done, although I wasn't trying to brush past the gameplay again today.
