# Restaurant Story session June 24th 2021

I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 1 batch of chicken and dumplings 2 batches of omelettes, and 1 batch of French toast today.

The game did not crash today. Not much else was done, although I wasn't trying to brush past the gameplay again today.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview
