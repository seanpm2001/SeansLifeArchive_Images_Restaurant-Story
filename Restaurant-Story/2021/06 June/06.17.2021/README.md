# Restaurant Story session June 17th 2021

I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 1 batch of chicken and dumplings and 4 batches of bacon and eggs today, so I could reach 10000 plates (currently total: 10010)

The game did not crash today. Not much else was done, although I wasn't trying to brush past the gameplay again today.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
