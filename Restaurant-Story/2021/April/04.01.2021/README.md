# Restaurant Story session April 1st 2021

I had a normal session today that lasted over 15 minutes (but less than 20 minutes)

## Remodeling

Not much remodeling was done today. 1 table was put into storage, 1 new counter was placed, 1 counter was moved, and 3 grills were swapped out for 3 ovens. Also, several pillars were added to the kitchen area.

## Dishes

I started making Bagels today, and I also made 3 batches of bacon and eggs.

## Revenue

No revenue was made today. I have had my restaurant closed for a while so I can stock up lots of food to sell. I have not reached my goal yet to start re-opening.
