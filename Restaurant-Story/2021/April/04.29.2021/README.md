# Restaurant Story session April 29th 2021

I had a usual session today and played for a little over 15 minutes. I made 3 batches of bacon and eggs, and I chose to also make Chicken and Dumplings instead of Bagels again today.

The game crashed upon closing the final popup, it hasn't done this before. Now both Bakery Story and Restaurant Story do this. It doesn't affect the gameplay too much, it isn't very tedious either.

## Remodeling

No remodeling was done today.

## Overview

See above.
