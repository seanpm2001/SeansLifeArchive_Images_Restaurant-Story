# Remodel - March 25th 2021

I was going to just have a normal session today and make a batch of `bacon & eggs` and a batch of `omelettes` but then I had an idea for a remodel. I considered holding it off for the next session, or the session after that, but then I decided to do it today (I did a similar remodel in Bakery Story today as well)

I spent some time today remodeling my restaurant in restaurant story. I made it so all food stacked to 1 counter, and I replaced the other counters with tables. I put back some of the original display, and 

The item I used to make all duplicates stack was `chicken and dumplings` which took 15 minutes to make. I was originally going to make `bagels` but it took so long to scroll to this so I decided to make it. I was extremely careful as to not repeat the incident last year with Fashion story. My restaurant is really orange now. 

In this process, I placed back 3 ovens and 3 grills, which brought back weird memories. Today was an extended session.
